## Level 1: Create a Triangle
## Level 2: Create Cubes
- how opengl pipeline
- buffers 
- how data is sent to gpu
- how shaders work
## Level 3: Create 3D Scene
- load objects
- have lighting, materials, physics, math
- add skybox
- create monkey ball
- implement all opengl effects
## Level 4: Advanced OpenGL
- do things on your own in opengl
- implement normal maps, shadows, pbr, rendering, materials
- implement your own algorithms
- implement god rays, caustics, how to fake caustics with textures
## Level 5: OpenGL God
- everything you do is in compute shaders
- spherical harmonics = better reflections
- ray tracing implemented + rasterization implemented
- runs at 120 fps
- 18 quadrillion triangles
- blocks at far distances = 1 pixel = use compute shader instead of rasterization to visualize them
    - inspired by nanite
- geometric culling
    - reduces geometry to whats visible in compute shaders
- global illumination - translated from another language
