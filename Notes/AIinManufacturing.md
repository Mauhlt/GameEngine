# AI's Impacts: 
Models: ChatGPT, Gemini, NanoBanana

- robotics:
- terms: AI, ML, DL, gen ai in designs, LLM = translator
- digital brain gets physical body
- genesis mission
- job safety analysis   
    - llm produces these fast 
    - provides great examples 
- automated inspection 
    - large vision model 
    - find scratch on part - AI learns what a scratch is = identifies it and stops
- proper functioning 
    - have ai learn what sounds + results are good
- injection molding 
    - AI = solves physics of cooling plastic with new designs
- liquid neural networks
    - liquid = adapts to the environment 
    - don't program every waypoint 
    - helps with grip - if part slips, robot adjusts
- fleet glue 
    - implement factory to make devices work together
- incremental sheet forming 
    - two robots push metal in 2 directions to precisely make a sheet
- Hyundai - Flexible Cells 
    - most manufacturing = fixed = fixed line for 1 vehicle
    - use AI to adapt change + adjust
    - cells for 1 feature but feature may adapt to different contexts
        - add seats to compact, to suv, to jeep
        - less area, smaller team, greater ability to produce
- Durac
    - breaks down CAD file into work instructions on how to put it together, torque values, what to look out for
    - if engineer changes bolt size, it auto-updates work instructions
- Need good idea + right tools
